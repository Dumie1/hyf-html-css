      <h3>Thatching</h3>
      <p>Thatched roofs have endured for thousands of years, offering a durable roofing option that not only adds character
        to a charming cottage, but a modern home as well. However, there are pros and cons to having a thatched roof and
        it helps to know what to expect if you are considering having a thatched roof on a house.</p>
      <p>
        When professionally installed, regularly maintained and sited away from overhanging trees, thatch can offer a durable roofing
        option that has a lifespan of anywhere from 15 to 20 years.
